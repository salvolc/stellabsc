\chapter{Summary and Conclusions}
In this thesis a proposal for a optimization study for the boosted event selection in a search for vector-like quark pair production in the channels TT\texorpdfstring{$\longrightarrow$}~WbZt and BB\texorpdfstring{$\longrightarrow$}~WtZb is submitted.
The analysis was performed with Monte Carlo samples where a preselection and a basic selection, caused by the specific decay channel, was applied.
As a measure for the significance the value $\frac{s}{\sqrt{b}}$ was considered.
The significance was calculated concerning an interval of the chosen final discriminant $m(Zb)$ for the BBS signal process and $m(Zt)$ for the TTS signal process.
With the optimization study performed in this thesis results a significance $\frac{s}{\sqrt{b}}_{TTS}=0.32$  for the TTS and a significance $\frac{s}{\sqrt{b}}_{BBS}=0.48$ for the BBS process.
The significance is proportional to the number of signal events, therefore the absolute value of  $\frac{s}{\sqrt{b}}_{TTS}$ is lower than $\frac{s}{\sqrt{b}}_{BBS}$, because there is a fewer number of events for the TTS process. 
The results for both TTS and BBS provide no significant distinction between background fluctuation and signal.
Therefore with the amount of data for a integrated luminosity  $\int L dt$ = \SI{3.2}{fb^{-1}} and this optimization study no discovery of vector-like quarks were possible.

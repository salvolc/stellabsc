\chapter{Optimization Studies for the Event Selection}

\section{Search for Discriminating Variables }
\label{distributions}
The first part of the optimization studies is the search for variables which provide a significant distinction between background and signal.
Caused by the basic selection discussed in section \ref{basic selection} there is already much background rejected.
Moreover the requirement of two large-R jets cause that the remaining background events contain high energies, because large-R jets, which fulfill the minimum criteria, have to be produced.
This complicates the search for discriminating variables, because the signal is expected to contain high energies,too, because of the massive vector-like quarks.\\
Figure \ref{H_T} shows the distribution for the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all jets in an event.

The number of events are expected for a integrated luminosity $\int L dt$ = \SI{3.2}{fb^{-1}}}
\label{H_T}
\end{figure}

The distribution shows, that the signal is shifted to the right compared to the background, because there is more energy in the events resulting from the very massive vector-like quarks. 
Figure \ref{Zpt} presents the distribution of the Z candidate $p_{T}$.

\label{Zpt}
\end{figure}

As mentioned for the $H_{T}$-distribution the signal is shifted to the right. That is as expeced, because the Z candidate results straight from the vector-like quark and should have a $p_{T}$ about \SI{450}{GeV}.
In figure \ref{leadingljet} the $p_{T}$ of the leading large-R jet is represented, which means the $p_{T}$ of the large-R jets with the highest $p_{T}$ in an event.

In the plot also a shift of the signal to the right is visible.
Figure \ref{mZb} shows the distribution of the invariant mass of the Z candidate and the highest $p_{T}$ b-jet and \ref{mZt} the invariant mass of the Z candidate and the highest $p_{T}$ top-jet.

The signal is shifted to the right caused by the same argumentation mentioned before. 
For the BBS signal process there is a peak at \SI{900}{GeV} in figure \ref{mZb}.
This is as expected because the Z candidate and the highest $p_{T}$ b-jet should result from the vector-like quark decay B \texorpdfstring{$\longrightarrow$}~Zb.
The peak of the TTS signal in figure  \ref{mZt} also results from a vector-like quarks decay T \texorpdfstring{$\longrightarrow$}~Zt, therefore the peak at \SI{900}{GeV} is also as expected.\\
Generally the presented distributions provide the possobility to achieve a distinction between background and signal by requiring limits for different variables.


\section{Significance for Different Cuts}
In this section the significance for different limits on variables, which are shown in section \ref{distributions}, are examined.
As used in previous analysis \cite{8tevanalysis} $m(Zb)$ is chosen as final discriminant for the BBS process, but in this analysis $m(Zt)$ is chosen sepeatly for the TTS process.
Boosted analysis provide the possibility of this variable by using the top-tag.
The optimization studys are performed concering an interval of the final discriminat distributions.
The interval is chosen, starting from the highest values of $m(Zb)$ and $m(Zt)$ until 80\% of all signal events of BBS and TTS are within the interval.
This interval is chosen because the signal is shifted to higher values of $m(Zb)$ and $m(Zt)$.
Therefore the interval in the interval the main background is rejected. 
The significance of the signal relative to the fluctuations of the background is investigated with formula $\frac{s}{\sqrt{b}}$, while $\sqrt{b}$ describes the statistical uncertainty of the background and $s$ the number of signal events.
Figure \ref{mZbcut} and \ref{mZtcut} show the significance as function of varying limits considering the vaiables presented in section \ref{distributions} for $m(Zb)$ and $m(Zt)$.

The distributions are consistent with the distributions for the different variables, because the trend is as expected by regarding the distributions in section \ref{distributions}.
For $H_{T}$ and leading large-R jet $p_{T}$ the significance has higher values for lower limits, because background and signal
